        Born in Athens, Greece, where I first had contact with theatre. I experienced the
        opening of a new dimension within this microcosm and I have been deeply influenced by
        the people working in Arts and Theatre in Athens between 2009 and 2015.
        I went on to study Theatre at the University of the Arts in Berlin. There, 
        I developed a relationship with the local theatre scene, mostly sourrounding
        the Volksb√ºhne am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz.
        I have worked as an actor in ensemble theatres, in cinema and as a
        freelancer. I have also made music for performances and translations.
